# The first step is to open up your python server and "download" the workshop files
* UBC provides students with server space where you can run python
* This is good for getting your bearings becasue everything is already set up.  You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system.
* Click this link to start your server: https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter
  * Login with your CWL.  You'll then be taken to a blank jupyter notebook!
* Now we're ready to add some files!
  * To do this, we open a comand terminal, and clone the github repository containing all the necisary files.
  * This may sound intimidating/confusing.  But don't worry, its easy.  You don't need to know comand line to do this.  I'll walk you through step by step!!
