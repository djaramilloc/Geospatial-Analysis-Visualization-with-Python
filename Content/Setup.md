# Step 1) Start python

###UBC provides students with server space where you can run python using a [Jupyter](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/jupyter)
* This is good for getting your bearings becasue everything is already set up.  You don't have to worry about installing anything on your own system.
 * Login with your CWL.  You'll then be taken to a blank jupyter notebook!

* Now we're ready to add some files!
  * To do this, we open a comand terminal, and clone the gitWorkshop Designhub repository containing all the necisary files.
  * This may sound intimidating/confusing.  But don't worry, its easy.  You don't need to know comand line to do this.  I'll walk you through step by step!!

# Step 2) Download the workshop files

### 1a) Copy the text inside the quotes "git clone https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python/" from the drop down menu.

### 1b) In they Jupyter window you just opened, click "New" in the top right and selecte "Terminal" from the dropdown menu

### 1c) In the new terminal window that opens, right click and paste the git clone command into the terminal window.  Then hit enter
* "git clone" is a command that tells git (a file tracking software) to to download a set of programs and files known as a repository
* https://github.com/ubc-library-rc/Geocoding-Web-Mapping-with-Python is the location of the repository for this workshop
